### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I develop software and play the tuba. Iâ€™m continuously trying to increase the nerdiness in my life.

I currently work as a Drupal/front-end web developer for a university in Washington, DC.

I also have a degree in music, which I am fortunate to still use while playing in the local music scene.
